# Number Classification Using CNN

This repository contains code for implementing number classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to accurately classify handwritten digits into their respective numerical labels (0-9) using deep learning techniques.

# Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the CNN model. It consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grid, making it a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating machine learning algorithms.
